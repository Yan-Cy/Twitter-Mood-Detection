I’m so glad I’m not like some of the sad people online who gossip and bully others for their entertainment because they have no life.
a lot of universities actively discourage even just one part-time job because it has a negative impact on studies--

We musn't allow bitterness and anger to make our hearts infertile to God’s gifts.
